  Welcome! The purpose of this application is to find the largest palindromic number between two numbers of your choosing.
  For example, if you input the numbers 0 and 105, the page will return 101 as the answer, the largest palindrome between 0 and 105.
  When entering numbers for the range, please use <b>decimal intergers only</b> and choose the appropiate box for the minimum 
  as well as the maximum value. You may also input the same number in both boxes to test if a single number is a palindrome or not.
